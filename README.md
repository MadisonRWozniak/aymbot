# AYMBot
An amalgamation of numerous other Discord.JS bots, created for use by [Affirming Youth Ministries](affirmingyouthministries.org)


## Features
Moderation, Music, Leveling, Currency, Role Menus, and more. (All WIP.)

## Disclaimers
This project is designed for a small number of semi-private servers, so some things may be oddly niche, or not 
completely finished, yet in prod regardless. This project does not store any user information currently, however that is
an intended aspect to accomodate planned features. When this is implemented, the bot will have a GDPR purge feature, to
allow bot admins to purge a users data in a way that is compliant with the EU's GDPR rules. 

### Affirming Youth Ministries
Affirming Youth Ministries is a non-profit Christian organization dedicated to fostering an LGBTQ+ inclusive community 
within Christianity, and striving to prevent further hate and harm. You can find them at https://affirmingyouthministries.org.
I am in no way officially afilliated with AYM, this is a hobby project done as a way to contribute to a group I personally
enjoy.
